## 🏗️ Architectural Design Decisions & Assumptions

### **1. System Architecture Philosophy**

**Layered Service Architecture**
We implemented a clean separation of concerns through distinct layers:
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP protocol specifics and request routing
- **Service Layer**: Contains core business logic and domain operations
- **Model Layer**: Defines data structures and type contracts
- **Validation Layer**: Ensures data integrity and security compliance

**Rationale**: This architecture promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability while enabling clear boundaries between different system responsibilities.

### **2. Data Persistence Strategy**

**In-Memory Storage Implementation**
Currently utilizing JavaScript Map structures for data persistence with the following considerations:

**Assumptions Made**:
- Development and demonstration environment usage
- Data persistence not required between server restarts
- Prototype phase allowing rapid iteration without database overhead

**Future Migration Path**: Architecture designed for seamless transition to persistent storage solutions (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) through service layer abstraction.

### **3. Question Type Design Framework**

**Multi-Format Assessment Support**
Our question type system accommodates diverse educational and assessment needs:

**Single-Selection Questions**
- Assumption: Exactly one correct answer per question
- Validation: Enforces singular correct option requirement
- Scoring: Binary evaluation (correct/incorrect)

**Multi-Selection Questions**
- Assumption: One or more correct answers possible
- Validation: Requires at least one correct option
- Scoring: All-or-nothing evaluation requiring complete accuracy

**Open-Response Questions**
- Assumption: Keyword-based evaluation sufficient for most use cases
- Limitation: Maximum 300 characters to ensure focused responses
- Scoring: Partial credit through keyword matching algorithms

### **4. API Design Principles**

**RESTful Architecture Compliance**
- Resource-based URL structures following REST conventions
- Appropriate HTTP method utilization (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent status code implementation across all endpoints
- Standardized response format ensuring client predictability

**Error Handling Strategy**
- Comprehensive error classification system
- User-friendly error messages with technical details for debugging
- Consistent error response structure across all failure scenarios

### **5. Security & Validation Assumptions**

**Input Validation Framework**
- Joi schema validation for all incoming requests
- Type safety enforcement through TypeScript compilation
- Sanitization of user-provided content to prevent injection attacks

**Authentication Assumptions**
- Current implementation assumes trusted environment
- Authentication layer designed for future integration
- Authorization hooks prepared for role-based access control

### **6. Performance & Scalability Considerations**

**Current Limitations Acknowledged**
- In-memory storage limits horizontal scaling
- Synchronous processing model for current use cases
- Single-node deployment assumptions

**Scalability Roadmap**
- Database abstraction layer prepared for distributed systems
- Async/await patterns implemented for future I/O intensive operations
- Stateless service design enabling load balancer compatibility

### **7. Development Workflow Assumptions**

**TypeScript-First Development**
- Strong typing reduces runtime errors
- Enhanced IDE support and developer experience
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

**Testing-Driven Quality Assurance**
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- Automated testing pipeline prevents regression
- Continuous integration readiness

## Design Choices and Assumptions

### Architecture
- **Layered Architecture**: Controllers handle HTTP requests, Services contain business logic, and Models define data structures
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between validation, business logic, and request handling
- **In-Memory Storage**: Using Maps for data storage (in production, this would be replaced with a database)

### Question Types
- **Single Choice**: Must have exactly one correct answer
- **Multiple Choice**: Must have at least one correct answer  
- **Text-based**: Supports keyword matching with up to 5 hint options and 300-character limit

### Validation
- **Input Validation**: Using Joi for comprehensive request validation
- **Business Logic Validation**: Custom validation for question type consistency
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints

### Scoring Logic
- **Single Choice**: Correct if the user selects the one correct option
- **Multiple Choice**: Correct if the user selects all correct options and no incorrect ones
- **Text-based**: Correct if the user's answer contains any of the correct keywords (case-insensitive)

### API Design
- **RESTful**: Following REST principles with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- **Consistent Response Format**: All responses follow the same structure with success, data, and message fields
- **Error Responses**: Meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Development

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict compiler options
- **ESLint**: Code linting for consistency and error prevention
- **Jest**: Comprehensive testing framework
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the application
